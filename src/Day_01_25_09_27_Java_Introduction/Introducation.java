		 * 
		 * Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for building secure,
		 *  portable, and scalable applications.
It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
making Java platform-independent.

Java is widely used for:

Web applications
Mobile apps (Android)
Enterprise applications
Desktop software
Cloud and distributed systems
Automation & testing tools (like Selenium)
