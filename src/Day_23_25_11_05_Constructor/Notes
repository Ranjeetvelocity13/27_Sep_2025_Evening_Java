Constructor in Java

A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects.
It is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created.

Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have any return type, not even void.
Every time an object is created using the new keyword, at least one constructor is called.

If no constructor is explicitly declared in a class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor during compilation.

======================================================================================================

Rules for Creating a Java Constructor

The constructor name must be exactly the same as the class name.
Constructors cannot be declared inside methods or other constructors — they must be declared directly inside the class body.

Constructors must not specify a return type (not even void).
If a return type is specified, it becomes a regular method, not a constructor.
Only access modifiers are allowed — public, protected, private, or package-private (no modifier).
Not allowed: static, final, abstract, or native.
You can declare more than one constructor in a class (constructor overloading).
Each constructor must have a different parameter list.

Types of Constructors
Default Constructor
User-defined Constructor

1. Default Constructor
Definition:

If a constructor is not explicitly declared in a Java class, the compiler automatically provides one during compilation.
This automatically provided constructor is called the default constructor.

======================================================================================================
Rules of the Default Constructor:

It is always a zero-argument (no-parameter) constructor.
The access modifier of the default constructor is the same as that of the class.
It contains an implicit call to super(), which invokes the parent class constructor.
It initializes the object with default values:

Numeric types → 0
Boolean → false
Object references → null

The default constructor is provided only if no other constructor is declared by the programmer.

2. User-defined Constructor

If a programmer explicitly declares a constructor in a Java class, it is called a user-defined constructor.
User-defined constructors can be of two types:

Zero-parameter constructor (also called no-argument constructor)
→ Declared explicitly by the programmer without parameters.

Parameterized constructor
→ Declared with one or more parameters to initialize object variables with custom values.

Constructor Chaining in Java

Definition:

Constructor Chaining in Java is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor within 
the same class or from the parent class.
It helps to reuse constructor code and avoid duplication when multiple constructors perform similar initialization tasks.



Purpose of Constructor Chaining

To reuse code between multiple constructors.
To initialize an object in multiple ways using constructor overloading.
To avoid redundancy by centralizing common initialization logic.

Types of Constructor Chaining

Constructor chaining can occur in two ways:
Within the same class (using this())
From parent class to child class (using super())

| **Point of Comparison**   | **Constructor**                                                                                            | **Method**                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**            | A constructor is a special block of code used to **initialize objects** when they are created.             | A method is a block of code used to **define the behavior or actions** of an object. |
| **Name**                  | Must have the **same name as the class**.                                                                  | Can have **any valid name**, not necessarily same as the class.                      |
| **Return Type**           | **No return type**, not even `void`.                                                                       | Must have a **return type**, which can be `void` or any data type.                   |
| **When Called**           | Automatically called **when an object is created** using `new`.                                            | Called **explicitly** using the object name or class name.                           |
| **Purpose**               | Used to **initialize** object variables.                                                                   | Used to **perform operations** or **define behavior**.                               |
| **Invocation**            | Called **implicitly** during object creation.                                                              | Called **explicitly** by the programmer.                                             |
| **Inheritance**           | **Not inherited**, but can be called from child class using `super()`.                                     | **Inherited** by subclass and can be overridden.                                     |
| **Overloading**           | Can be **overloaded** (multiple constructors with different parameters).                                   | Can be **overloaded** and **overridden**.                                            |
| **Modifiers**             | Can use only **access modifiers** (`public`, `private`, etc.). Cannot be `static`, `final`, or `abstract`. | Can use various modifiers like `static`, `final`, `synchronized`, `abstract`, etc.   |
| **Return Statement**      | Does not return any value. Cannot use `return` to send a value.                                            | Can return a value using the `return` keyword (unless `void`).                       |
| **Call to Superclass**    | Always calls the parent constructor (implicitly or explicitly).                                            | Does not automatically call parent class methods.                                    |
| **Use of `this` keyword** | Used to call another constructor within the same class using `this()`.                                     | Used to refer to the current object or call another method.                          |
